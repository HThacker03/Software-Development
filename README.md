# Software-Development
This reopsitory exists to hold my assignments for future classes in order to keep everything organized and easily accessible.

About me: 
Hi I'm Hannah I graduated high school back in 2021, and have recently started the amazing Software Development course here at Southwest tech. 
Before joining this class I was trying to decide on a career and tried a few professions including cabinet making.
In my personal life I enjoy a number of different crafts like crochet or cross stitch each of which are incredibly detail oriented.

I am taking this program in order to have a steady career in a field I enjoy working in.
